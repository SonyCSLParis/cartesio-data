[Cartesio](www.cartesio.news) is a research project resulting from the collaboration between the Autorit√† per le Garanzie nelle Comunicazioni (AGCOM), Sony Computer Science Labs (CSL) in Paris - the technological partner - and the Physics Department of the University of Rome "La Sapienza". Cartesio aims to study the online information system from the users' perspective, through an open experience. Through the direct participation of citizens, Cartesio provides an opportunity to understand how some social phenomena are perceived, how information is evaluated and what are the priority topics for citizens, in full respect of privacy. Moreover, as a transparent research initiative, at the end of the project the results will be made public and disseminated and the research data will be made available in aggregated form and in open data format. You can play through the online platform or by downloading the App. Simply register (completely anonymously), choose the topics of interest and start playing, providing a subjective assessment of the quality of the information received. At the end of the experience, you will have more information about the quality of the information perceived during the experience and the perception of the other participants. Moreover, by repeating the experience over time, it will also be possible to observe how these perceptions evolve.

### The Cartesio Experience

The spread of fake news is a danger to public opinion forming in a democratic society in which the information system and the media play a fundamental role. Orientation is not easy, especially on the web: the multiplicity of sources, the speed of news updates, the abundance of information complicate the choice. By taking part in the Cartesio project, you can contribute in person to providing the cognitive elements to help citizens disentangle themselves from the online information system. All you have to do is answer a few questions and have your say: during the experience you will be able to assess the reliability of the news and express your opinion on some of the most important phenomena affecting our society. Your contribution will help to better understand how news is perceived and to improve the quality of information!

### Coming soon

We are currently working on the scientific analysis of the results but in the meanwhile ... check them out! You can find theme here:
